# Quiz Application

## Purpose of the Program

This is a simple console-based quiz application written in C#. The application asks the user a series of questions and checks if the user's answers match the correct answers. The user has a limited time to answer each question. If the user doesn't answer within the time limit, the application automatically moves to the next question.

## Instructions on How to Run the Program

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the solution file in Visual Studio.
3. Press `F5` or click `Start Debugging` in the `Debug` menu to run the program.

## Additional Information or Notes

- The questions and answers are currently hardcoded into the program. You might want to modify them to fit your needs.
- The time limit for each question is currently set to 10 seconds. You can adjust this in the `StartQuiz` method.
- The scoring system is very basic (one point per correct answer). You might want to modify it to add more complexity.
